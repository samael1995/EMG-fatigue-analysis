# EMG fatigue analysis

This repository includes 3 sub projects related to EMG signal processing.

  1-	EMG fatigue feature extraction: in this file we define 4 types of frequency-based features for fatigue analysis including median frequency, mean frequency, peak frequency and total power of EMG signal.
 
  2-	EMG Muscle activation: we provide a code to decide when a muscle is activated and deactivated based on EMG signal.
   
  3-	Fatigue feature analysis: this file includes datasets of leg press EMG recording signals of 21 individuals, Median frequency of beginning and ending of quadriceps muscles were studied.
